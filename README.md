# godia
GoDia is a simple go program that takes golang files and produces a .dia diagram of the structs and their references.  The diagram below is generated by running the program on itself.

This has bugs and is a work in progress.  I threw it together this morning so I could better visualize a large go project I am working on.  However, it does work for my purposes.

Features:
  Uses DIAs UML diagram
  The "stereotype" is set to the package name
  All fields and their types are shown
  If the .dia file already exists when this is run, it will attempt to keep the position, color and size the same.
